# Hello-World

Hi!

Kiana here, I am currently enrolled here in <strong><a href="http://avionschool.com">Avion School</a></strong>. I want to be a software engineer because I want to enhance my skills in coding especially in Web Designing, to fulfill my dream to be a Web Developer or became a Project Manager in the near future.
I like reading both books and e-books specifically, pop-fiction novels. I also like korean stuffs like kpop, kdrama, and korean food.
